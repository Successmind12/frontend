        <h1>Yadhi, guidance</h1>
        <p>What is guidance? Guidance refers to direction, direction to the right path.
            True guidance comes from ALLAH(SWT). He gave us the Qur'an, sent us messengers,
            and gave us insight.  
        </p>

        <div>
            <h2>Taking a closer look at guidance</h2>
            <p>Following the right guidance brings us closer to our real purpose
               of existence, which is to worship our maker, who is the only deity
               worthy of worship. By doing that, we begin to get the true meaning of 
               life through living a life of purpose. We begin to get convinced that darkness
               and light are different. We begin to see the reality of this life and how minute its worth is 
               compared to what is prepared fro us in the hereafter. Through true guidance, we're able to
               redefined ourselves and our values, our moral changes and we begin to leave an undelliiable 
               footprint for others to follow. </p>
            <p>The following are benefits of following true guidance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inner peace</li>
                <li>Happiness</li>
                <li>Contentment</li>
            </ul>
