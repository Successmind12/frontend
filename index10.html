            <p>What is Shukr?</p>
            <p class="p1">Shukr in simple words refers to gratitude, it refers to recognizing our master blessings on us
                if we're to count the blessings of our Lord, certainly, we won't be able to count them.
                Our gracious master encourages us to be grateful to him, for he gives us more when we're grateful to him.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">Shukr isn't limited to just saying Alhamdulilah, it also includes using everything ALLAH(SWT) has given 
                us in his service, using them appropriately, understanding that everything we have came from him. Be it power,
                wealth, children, knowledge, or any good thing we have, they're from ALLAH(SWT). He made us understand this 
                suratul Mulk verse 23. 
            </p>
            <p class="p3 p4">Gratitude is a key value that has been proven overtime to reduce stress, anxiety, also serves as one
                of the keys to happiness. It gives us contentment, make us see less of problems and more of our blessings.
                We're able to see past our current situation and see a brighter side of life. We're  able to stay positive in a life
                full of negativities. 
            </p>
            <p>ALLAH(SWT) told  the Banu Israil through to the mouth of Prophet Musa(AS), that if they're grateful, he'll give 
                them more. The Banu Israil were going through the trauma of their past sufferings from the hands of Pharoh, yet they
                were reminded to be grateful. What we learn here is that gratitude is not limited to good times only, during
                the bad times, there's still something to be grateful for. The more we're grateful, the better we're able to deal
                with life challenges.
