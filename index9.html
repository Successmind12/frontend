            <p>Duniyah, what is Duniyah? Duniyah refers to this present world,
            the place we  stay after our birth, it feels like home, however, it isn't.
            It's a place full of distractions, it makes us forget our purpose of existing in it.
            Our Lord warns us a lot of times not be deceived by the glittering things in it, as they make
            us forget our purpose and stray from the path we're meant to follow.
            </p>

            <p class="smooth">Verily, what's in this life but a matter of delusion? Says the Qur'an, we're made to
            understand that, what we see as gold in Duniyah isn't gold, rather it is a mirage that'll
            fade once we pass away. Hence, we're constantly reminded not be deceived by it, we're given 
            so many facts in the Qur'an to prove to us that certainly the afterlife is better than it.
            </p>

            <p class = "redgang">The master deceiver, Shaytan, tries many ways to trick us, he makes what's more important 
            seems less important and what's is less important more important, he makes us forget what we ought
            to remember, and remember what we ought to forget. He makes the Duniyah seems so important to us
            that we might almost think that's there's no hereafter.
            </p>

            <p class="redgang cool">Remembrance of ALLAH(SWT), being with righteous companions, constant recitation and pondering 
            over the Qur'an, doing lots of goods deeds are some of the ways we can live in this Duniyah without
            losing our sight of the hereafter, our purpose of existence. Verily, the hereafter is better than this 
            Duniyah.
